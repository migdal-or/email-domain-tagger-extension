# email-domain-tagger-extension
firefox addon to insert email tagged with current website domain

We all love to hide from spammers by supplying identifiable addresses like username+almart@gmail.com.\
This approach gives us an ability to identify where the data leaked from, to setup ban filters to reject arbitrary emails, and to have many accounts when we need them.\
This extension simplifies this by auto-combining your predefined address with the current website URL.
